## Required Features

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I was able to stack and add constraints to the viewController, but not the detailViewController. When stacked, the image covers the whole screen as expected. However, adding constraints fixed the photo but not the text as it refused to show in any orientation.
